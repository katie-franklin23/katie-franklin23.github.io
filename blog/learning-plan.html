    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      My long term goal is to become an experienced Front End Developer and be
      my own boss. I would love to build up a comprehensive portfolio of my web
      design work. It would be awesome to work remotely with this job and travel
      to different parts of the world.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
      One of my biggest strengths is that I put a lot of effort in to
      understanding the content I am reading or watching. I want to make sure I
      understand what I have just read/watched before moving on to the next
      subject. A limitation would be if I have learned a lot on a day, I find it
      difficult to motivate myself to move on to my next area of learning. I can
      try and improve upon this by making more of an effort to take small breaks
      away from my screen. Even if it means going into another room and having a
      cup of tea or just having a chat with a family member. That way when I
      return to my desk, I feel re-energised and can re-focus.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I would like to be able to work well in a team environment when it comes
      to coding. It would be great to work with different people on my cohort on
      projects and see what we can learn from each other. I think this would be
      such an important transferrable skill I could take into my first Junior
      Developer role.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include:
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I will manage to work productively by treating this course like a
      full-time job. I’ll ensure I’m going to sleep at a decent time, starting
      my day like I would a regular workday, by doing hours such as 9am – 5pm.
      This will ensure I have devoted enough time during the week to get through
      my learning and complete the assignments. Every Sunday, I’ll look at the
      upcoming Sprint curriculum and write down a plan for what I aim to
      complete by the end of each day. To ensure I work productively with other
      people in the Dev Academy community, I’ll make sure I’m communicating
      effectively. If I have an issue or query, I’ll let the other students and
      facilitators know. I’ll also make sure to answer any questions that come
      up by other students if I know the answer to. When things are building up
      and starting to get to me, I will take a break from my screen. I will
      either go for a walk to clear my head or talk to one of my friends/family
      members.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      5.A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Firstly, I will try and research online to see if I can solve the problem
      myself. If after half an hour, I have been researching and still haven’t
      found the answer to my problem, I’ll reach out on the Discord channel and
      see if one of the facilitators or students is able to help with my issue.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect the facilitation team to be helpful and supportive to our
      queries. Being in frequent communication is great. Communicating to us
      whether there are things we can improve on, tips and tricks to help us
      with our coding or even just offering an ear to listen.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>I’ll have daily block out times of going for a walk each day.</p>
