      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is a relationship with ourselves and others. It involves us
        interpreting these emotions and understanding why we or others are
        reacting the way that they are. It's also understanding that the first
        emotion that someone reacts to, may not be the correct emotion they want
        displayed. For example, a fiery rage might be just be someone in dire
        need of help. Anger might be a cover for sadness. Emotional Intelligence
        is learned. We pick up on emotions through our childhood and this shapes
        us into who we grow up to be.

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        EQ is Emotional Quotient and IQ is Intelligence Quotient. IQ is related
        to academic intelligence. EQ is internal and external. Itâ€™s how we think
        about ourselves and others. It is having self awareness - understanding
        our moods and other peoples moods and how this affects others. Having a
        high IQ might mean you are good at a particular subject, for instance
        physics but that doesn't necessarily mean you have a high EQ. Having
        high EQ is just as important now in the workplace as you need to work
        well with people to succeed.

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is important as it helps us build relationships
        with others. It can also reduce conflict when we can pick up on others
        emotions.
