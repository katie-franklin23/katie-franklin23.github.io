      <h2>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I got stuck on a simple problem back when I used to work in a customer
        facing role. Two people came in at the same time for an afternoon
        appointment - they had been double booked. We were understaffed at the
        time so noone could see one of the extra appointments. I told the
        clients that I would see the first person who arrived and if it took
        longer than half an hour for the appointment, the second customer would
        have to be re-booked. I tried to rush through the first appointment for
        the first person so the second person wouldn't have to wait as long. I
        found that it ended up stressing me out and I didn't want the first
        customer to feel like I had rushed through the info. Half an hour into
        the appointment and still had a long way to go, I went to the front desk
        and told the client that was still waiting that unfortunately they had
        to be re-booked as it was going over the time allocated. I felt
        frustrated throughout this process and learnt from this that if it
        happened again, I would just re-book one of the appointments straight
        away so not to waste anyone else's time.

      <h2>How I elegantly solved the problem</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        I feel like I elegantly solved the 'daBee' problem. In this problem, I
        was faced with the task to split a string (sequence of characters that
        consists of either text, numbers, or symbols) into individual words and
        filter out words with a 'buzz' sound! I watched one of the Foundations
        videos that Gerard had posted and he spoke about the woof tests. In the
        test at the end 'Everything, Everywhere, All at once' (the last test on
        the page), it tested you on all of these skills together. I practised
        the test myself and then was able to problem solve from there and apply
        it to the 'daBee' challenge! It helped seeing how an example was solved.
        I found it much easier to apply it to my problem.

      <h2>
        How confident I feel with each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        • Pseudocode – I am still getting used to this. I did this in some of
        the later challenges in JS Kata. It definitely helps when I do it as
        it’s nice to see it all written out and breaking it down into smaller
        steps.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Trying something – this was my go to method. I always wanted to see if
        I got the answer right. It was a good and a bad thing as sometimes I
        would pass a couple of the tests in one category but there would still
        be one of the tests failing. I got there in the end with trial and
        error.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Rubber ducky method – I haven’t used this technique yet!
        <br />
        <br />
        •Reading error messages – this was helpful to see. I would research the
        error message and look at forums to see where to go from there.
        <br />
        <br />
        •Console.logging – I did this in the built-in methods challenge. It was
        helpful to see it written out.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Googling – I feel pretty confident with this and normally from Google
        search results will go on the MDN web docs or W3Schools page to see
        explanations.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Asking your peers for help – I asked a question in Tech Questions and
        my peers were supportive trying to help.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Asking coaches for help – I feel pretty confident with this. I have
        had a couple of calls with Johnny where he was very helpful explaining
        what I had to do to get the solution. I also popped on a call with
        Gerard and Lari where they helped me with one of my issues in the
        challenge.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Improving your process with reflection – I spend the least amount of
        time on my reflections. I feel like I’m okay with this process. I’ll
        update it as soon as I’ve done the topic so it’s fresh in my mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        I was spending too long on a problem and I thought the solution was
        probably really simple so I stalled until I felt like I wasn't going to
        get the answer on my own. Once I had asked, I wish I had asked sooner!
