      <h1>What are Margins, Borders and Padding?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Understanding all of these is essential in web design as these different
        properties let us see how content will appear on our webpage. Content
        can be made up of either text or images. What's neat about all of these
        is that they are all measured in pixels and you can adjust the setting
        for each side of an element (top, right, bottom and left). In my blog
        today, I'll be using our friend Arnold (below) as our content and will
        include a screenshot of what each property looks like when coding.

      <h2>What is padding?</h2>
      <p>
        Padding is the amount of space around specific content on a page. In the
        picture below, the blue fill around Arnold indicates the padding around
        him. Padding is always transparent and is measured in pixels.

      <h2>What are borders?</h2>
      <p>
        The border goes around the content and the padding. Like padding,
        borders are also measured in pixels but it has another property you can
        identity it with. You can set the width, changing how thin or thick the
        border can be. The border line can be a solid line, a dashed line and
        can be a specific color or transparent. Here the border is demonstrated
        by the colour black and a thick line.

      />

      <h2>What are margins?</h2>
      <p>
        The margin is the space outside of the border. Margins are always
        transparent and provide space in between the content and anything that
        sits around it. In our example, it is highlighted by the colour green.
        Margins and padding get confused often. Margins are the space outside of
        the border, whereas padding is the space around the actual content and
        is inside the border. Margins can be in pixels or as a percentage.
