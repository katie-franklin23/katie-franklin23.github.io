      <h2>
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HTML describes the structure of the webpage. It is the bare bones of the
        page. CSS is used for the appearance of the page and can be used to
        style it. JavaScript is how we interact with everything on our webpage!
        <br />
        <br />
        Here’s an analogy to help you better understand this. HTML is like the
        structure of a house. When a house is built, the builder lays down the
        foundation to make sure it’s structured properly and safe. It is
        essential that the foundation is solid so we can live in the house. A
        house would be boring and not attract as many buyers if there was
        nothing inside of it. This is where CSS comes in. In this example, it
        can be represented by an Interior Designer. They will put furniture and
        paintings inside to make sure the house looks nice and to increase the
        potential of someone buying the house. Lastly, JavaScript is the
        electrics of the house. A house wouldn’t be great to live in, without
        electricity right! This is where the wiring of the house comes in and in
        turn provides power. Once the electricals have been set up, we can turn
        lights on and use the stove top to cook food. In relation to web design,
        JavaScript is how we interact with everything, essentially providing a
        function.

      <h2>
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life
      </h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        Control flow is how a computer runs code from top to bottom (line by
        line). Sometimes when coding, we don’t want to run code this way – this
        is where <strong>Control Flow</strong> comes in. It allows our program
        to make decisions about what code will be executed and when it will be
        executed. <br />

        <br />
        In JavaScript, <strong>Conditional Statements</strong> are checks to see
        if a condition is either true or false. If the condition is true then
        run code <strong>x</strong>, if it’s false, then run code
        <strong>y</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Loops</strong> are a set of instructions that are continually
        repeated until a certain condition has been achieved. They help us
        perform repetitive tasks. An example of this in everyday life, is doing
        a repetition of an exercise at the gym. Take for example, doing a bicep
        curl. Firstly, you would hold a dumbbell in one hand. Next, you slowly
        curl the dumbbell towards you by bending your elbow, keeping your elbow
        close to your body. Lastly, you lower the dumbbell to the starting
        position. You can repeat this task several times – for instance you
        might want to do this 5 times. A loop saves us the hassle of doing this.
        It does the difficult part of the work. For example in this case, if we
        wanted to do bicep curls 5 times, we would input this as a loop and tell
        the computer to stop doing the loop once it has been completed 5 times.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Document Object Model, or more simply known as The DOM, is an object
        representation of an HTML document. The Document is the file for
        instance an ‘HTML’ file. The Object is the tags and elements inside the
        HTML file. The Model is the layout or structure. The DOM is incredibly
        useful for web developers as we can access these HTML elements in the
        webpage and manipulate various elements. We access the DOM by using
        Google Chrome and going to 'Developer Tools.' If you right click on any
        webpage, then click 'Inspect', it will open Developer Tools. We can use
        JavaScript to interact with the DOM to see how our structure, content
        and style will look on the webpage when manipulated. For example, you
        may want to change the background colour of a webpage to see what it
        would like (ie changing the background and border colour of this webpage
        from pink to light blue). The DOM allows this without permanently
        changing it. It is essentially a preview of what our webpage will look
        like. The DOMs layout is a tree like structure of all the HTML elements
        on the web page. I’ve included a diagram below so you can visualize
        this.

      <h2>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Objects and arrays are both containers in JavaScript which hold
        properties. Objects are used to represent a single item with unchanging
        characteristics. For example, we may want to create an object for a
        silver car, brand Toyota. The car has defined characteristics. These
        don't change.
        <br />
        <br />
        We use arrays when we want to make and store a list of many items in a
        single variable. They are really helpful for counting items as they can
        be accessed by their numerical position in the list. We might want to
        create an array of 'Vacation wishlist' - in this array you can list
        different countries you wish to visit. Each of the countries have
        different properties.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Functions are a set of statements that perform a task or calculate a
        value. Functions are useful in that we can use them to run certain
        tasks. An example of using a function would be 'pressing play' on your
        'Liked Songs' playlist in spotify and it plays that playlist for you.
        Functions work much the same, we are telling the computer what to do,
        then calling it and expected the desired outcome.
