      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>
        1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
        how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
        you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>

        One time I found a missing wallet on the beach. No one else was around,
        I could have kept the wallet but knew it would be the wrong thing to do.
        If I were to have lost my wallet, I would hope someone would do the
        right thing and return it to me. I checked inside and luckily there were
        contact details listed for the person. I got in touch with them,
        returned it and felt good about it after.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
        your values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        I grew up with a Filipina mother and Kiwi father. Growing up with two
        different ethnicities made me aware of both cultures and what they
        offered. The Filipina community is very warm, loves social gatherings
        and are always willing to help. That shaped my values and identity as I
        see how important it is to be there for others and we need to have good
        relationships in life. I feel like New Zealand has a more
        individualistic type of culture where you have your own unique voice but
        need to rely on yourself a bit more. Both cultures greatly influenced my
        identity. I strive to be kind to everyone and have integrity in
        everything I carry out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        My strengths are that I have a lot of empathy. I understand what it’s
        like to be in someone else’s position. This will support me during my
        learning journey as I’ll be able to relate well to other students.
        Another strength I have is that I put a lot of effort into whatever I
        do. I will make sure to show up every day and get through what I need
        to.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        A limitation I have is that I don’t have experience with coding. It’s
        all new to me. This will be frustrating at times as I won’t understand
        everything. In prior jobs, I know what I’m doing but with learning
        coding, it’s like learning a new language. It will take a bit of getting
        used to with learning new material. I am trying to be patient and trust
        the process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In one of my previous jobs, there was a colleague in my direct team who
        was extremely difficult to work with. She was often in a bad mood and
        many people were afraid to ask her questions for help. Because I worked
        closely with her, I had to figure out a strategy for us to work better
        together. I came up with the idea of having fortnightly catch up
        meetings just her and myself. That way we had a regular time slot to
        discuss work and any issues. It ended up being effective and our rapport
        and relationship grew.
