        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits us as we can
        use this to improve our regular day to day lives. Everyone experiences
        stress from time to time but once we understand that our brains are
        malleable, it gives people hope that they can cope better when difficult
        things happen. Our brains are constantly reshaped by our daily
        experiences. Also, knowing that intelligence is malleable, encourages
        people to learn new things, acquire new skills and strengthen our neural
        pathways.

      <h2>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit
      </h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
       I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit
        by engaging in daily mindfulness activities, by going for daily walks, eating well and ensuring I'm getting enough sleep!
        <br />
        <br />

      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Practising daily mindfulness is a good way to increase your
        neuroplasticity. It can change the way you think, feel and behave. It
        promotes positive changes in the brain pathway. It can lead to reduced
        stress. When we are less stressed, we can concentrate better and
        increase those neural pathways in our brain. You can also increase your
        neuroplasticity by choosing an activity that is meaningful to you and
        engaging with the activity on a regular basis. For example, learning a
        new language. This can also lead to better problem-solving skills and
        can improve your multi-tasking ability.

        <br />
        <br />
        Even just spending 10 – 15 minutes a day engaging with a new activity can help. Research shows it takes repetition to keep those
        pathways strong. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Physical exercise has benefits not only for our
        physical health but also our mental health. It can make us sleep better but it also,
        strengthens our brain. Walking or going for a run, can lead to stronger
        cognitive functioning such as learning and memory retention.

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Growth Mindset is having the mindset where you believe new abilities can
        be achieved through practice. People with this mindset see learning new
        challenges as exciting and a way to problem solve. They are more likely
        to succeed and embrace new challenges. They see failing as a part of
        learning. It is relevant because it fosters a healthier approach to
        learning.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having a Fixed Mindset is the opposite whereby people with this mindset
        believe qualities such as intelligence are fixed. This is not a helpful
        mindset to have as it cuts you off for opportunities to grow and learn.

        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes. I think at times I have a fixed mindset and I become too fixated on
        finding the answer to the problem, instead of embracing it as a
        challenge and a part of the learning experience. I am going to try and
        adopt a more positive way of thinking and see challenges as a chance to
        learn and succeed.
<br>
        <br />
      </p>
    </p>
    <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>

    <p>
      I am going to reframe challenges as opportunities and chances to learn. I am going to be kinder to myself and know that it’s okay to make mistakes. This is a part of my learning journey.

      <h2>My Learning Plan and Strategy</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
      I will integrate this into my learning journey by incorporating daily mindfulness into my mornings and keeping up with regular walks throughout the week. I’ll also take on a more helpful attitude of trying to solve the problem and see that as a success even if I don’t get the correct answer straight away.
